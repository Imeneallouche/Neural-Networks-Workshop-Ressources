# Mastering the Chain Rule in Calculus

## **1. Introduction to the Chain Rule**  
The chain rule is a fundamental tool in calculus for finding derivatives of **composite functions** (functions made by combining other functions). This lesson breaks down the chain rule using intuitive examples, from simple linear relationships to real-world machine learning applications.

## **2. Quick Review: Derivatives and the Power Rule**  

### **2.1 Basic Derivative**  
- **Derivative**: Measures how a function's output changes as its input changes (slope of the tangent line).  
- **Example**: For

## **3. The Chain Rule Explained**  

### **3.1 Simple Example: Weight → Height → Shoe Size**  
- **Scenario**:  
  - **Weight → Height**:

- **Chain Rule Application**:  
  - Derivative of Shoe Size w.r.t.

  - Interpretation: A 1-unit increase in weight leads to a 1/2-unit increase in shoe size.  

### **3.2 Complex Example: Hunger → Ice Cream Craving**
