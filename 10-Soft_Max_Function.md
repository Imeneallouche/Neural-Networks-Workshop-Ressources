# The SoftMax Derivative

## **1. Introduction to SoftMax and Its Derivative**  
The **SoftMax function** converts raw neural network outputs into probabilities, essential for classification tasks. Understanding its derivative is critical for **backpropagation**, enabling the optimization of weights and biases via gradient descent.

### **3.2 Applying the Quotient Rule**  
\[
\frac{\partial \text{SoftMax}(s)}{\partial z_s} = \frac{e^{z_s} \cdot (e^{z_s} + e^{z_v} + e^{z_g}) - e^{z_s} \cdot e^{z_s}}{(e^{z_s} + e^{z_v} + e^{z_g})^2}
\]  
Simplify:  
\[
= \text{SoftMax}(s) \cdot (1 - \text{SoftMax}(s))
\]

### **4.2 Simplifying the Derivative**  
\[
\frac{\partial \text{SoftMax}(s)}{\partial z_v} = \frac{0 - e^{z_s} \cdot e^{z_v}}{(e^{z_s} + e^{z_v} + e^{z_g})^2} = -\text{SoftMax}(s) \cdot \text{SoftMax}(v)
\]

## **7. Key Takeaways**  
1. **Same-Class Derivative**: Reflects how a change in the raw score of class \( i \) affects its own probability.  
2. **Cross-Class Derivative**: Measures how a change in the raw score of class \( j \) impacts the probability of class \( i \).  
3. **Backpropagation**: These derivatives enable efficient optimization in multi-class neural networks.
